<p class="newp">I've finally decided to add a What's New page. Anyway, this update is potentially one of the biggest, if not the biggest yet. The following was added:<br>
<ul>
    <li>More header improvements (made more accurate to YouTube's in 2007)</li>
    <li>Added SubRocks 2009 player (more like readded, but there's no HTML5 recreation of the 2007 player that works)</li>
    <li>Added Inbox (access by clicking the number next to the mail icon on the header)</li>
    <li>Video responses (figured that would make people use the site more, and make responses easier (obviously))</ul></p>
    <p>That is all for todays update. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, join our Discord (linked on the Help page).</p>
